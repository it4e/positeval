# Assessing Differences in Precision with Posit Floating Point Format compared to IEEE 754

The purpose of this project is to conduct a comparative study of the precision comparing the 32-bit IEEE 754 and Posit32 floating point representations in high performance computing. For this we will use Matrix multiplication.
